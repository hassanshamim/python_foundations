## About

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the Python programming language.  We will also cover general programming concepts, methodologies, tools and vocabulary.  Towards the end of the course we will apply what we’ve learned to some common, tedious tasks so we may leverage our newfound programming skills to solve real-world problems.

**Note**: This course draws heavily from [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  This book available for free online and for purchase in print.  While we shall follow the general outline of the book, some course content shall differ.  I'll do my best to provide different examples than presented in the book, so it can be considered a supplemental material resource for those who would like additional practice or review.



## Aims and Outcomes

1. Feel confident enough to take a more specialized Python Course, and contribute to a Hack Oregon Project.

2. Feel comfortable putting "[proficient in Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2fkv4h/when_are_you_considered_proficient_in_python/)" on your CV.

3. Read, understand, and write beautiful Python code.

4. Feel comfortable uploading and downloading code with Github and maybe contributing to open source projects.

5. See python as a useful tool for solving repetitive tasks.

6. Join the Hack Oregon community of professionals, students, events, and communications that will help your career and the state of Oregon.

## Core Principles

- **Learn by doing** - Project work and getting your hands dirty is essential to you learning to code. Each class period will be split between lecture and applying what we've learned.

- **Learn from analogies** - Programming concepts can be complicated. Simple relatable examples will help you understand what you need to know.

- **Learn to “Fish”** - Our course only lasts 8 weeks, and there’s no way to cover all of Python. I will teach you the skills to continue learning beyond “Python Foundations”

- **80/20** - “80% of the effect is from 20% of the causes” I’ll try to teach you the 20% that will give you 80% of the functionality of Python.

### Required tools

- git (we'll install in class)

- [A text editor](resources/text_editors.md)

- [Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/)

  ​

### Course Communication

The primary platform that we use in Hack University to communicate is Slack. If you haven't been invited to slack yet or want to set it up with another email address, shoot me an email and I'll get you invited. Feel free to check out any of the other channels too. It's a good way to get exposure to new topics and ideas.



### Certificate of Completion

Certificates are distributed via an open sourced badging program, [badgr.io](http://www.badgr.io/), which is compliant with [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) the current industry recognized leader for verifiable digital credentials.



#### Grading Policy

Badges will be issued based upon attendance and participation in class. No more than 3 absences will be allowed, no more than 2 being unexcused. If you must miss class, please contact me, and we'll schedule a time to catch you up.
