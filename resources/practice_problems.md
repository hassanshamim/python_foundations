1. [Codingame](www.codingame.com)  - Visualized practice problems online.  Checks your solutions for accuracy.
2. [DailyProgammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) - random programming challenges by level (Easy, Medium, Hard).  Solved in many different languages.  I love this one.
3. [Checkio](https://checkio.org/)
4. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
5. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Math problems.  They get hard (math-wise)
6. [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) Practice Problems in the context of Bioinformatics
7. [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) These challenges are often harder.  Have to google for solutions (or look at my github repo)
