# At the start of class

1. Open your terminal
   1. Windows: cmdr.exe, or git-bash
   2. Mac: Terminal or iTerm
2. Change the working directory to your python_foundations folder
   - Mac: `cd path/to/your/directory`
   - Windows: `cd path\to\your\directory`
3. Fetch the latest changes from using `git`
   - `git pull`
   - If you have errors, let me know.  Most often the solution will be:
     - `git stash`
     - `git pull`
     - `git stash pop`
4. Launch the Anaconda Navigator GUI
5. Select the Environments Tab
6. Click the green triangle on your environment name and select "Open with Jupyter Notebook"

### Git isn't working?

Temporary solution: 

-  navigate to the lesson of the day on Github
-  click on the lesson,
-  select `raw` on the top right of the file.
- Save that page (File > Save Page as) and name it the same as the file.
  - i.e. `lesson2.ipynb` not `lesson2.ipynb.txt`
- Find that new file in your Jupyter Notebook and run it.
